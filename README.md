# Twitter End To End Data Pipeline Using Airflow

## Description
This is an End-To-End Data Engineering Project using Airflow and Python. In this project, we have extracted data using Twitter API, used python to transform data, deploy the code on Airflow/EC2 and save the final result on Amazon S3. This project helps in understanding how Apache Airflow is used for developing, scheduling, and monitoring batch-oriented workflows.
